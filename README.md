# Stock-Price-Prediction
The project helps to predict the rise or decline of any stock using machine learning. The algorithms used are 
1. FFNN  
2. LSTM 


Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN):

A Feed Forward Neural Network is an artificial neural network in which the connections between nodes does not form a cycle. The opposite of a feed forward neural network is a recurrent neural network, in which certain pathways are cycled. The feed forward model is the simplest form of neural network as information is only processed in one direction. While the data may pass through multiple hidden nodes, it always moves in one direction and never backwards.




Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is specifically designed to handle sequential data, such as time series, speech, and text. LSTM networks are capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data, which makes them well suited for tasks such as language translation, speech recognition, and time series forecasting.
